I ran this project using anaconda command prompt, here's how I did that so I don't forget

I ran this off my D: drive, so first I had to set that in the command prompt
	D:
Then I had to specify my folder
	cd D:\WebScraper
Then I could run the project
	python run_restaurant_data.py

This produced the Restaurant_Data_Scraped.csv file

In this CSV file, I added in restaurant type manually
The options were:
	Table Service
	Fast Food
	Dessert/Coffee
I dont really have a science or math based approach to this, it is all pretty much anecdotal or I looked at their menu
Yelp has a $ rating as well, but not every restaurant I got data for had this rating so I didn't use it.
