I really had wanted to get all the reviews from yelp from a 10 year period for each restaurant. 

However, I couldn't figure out how to get the HTML selector to grab individual reviews instead of just the overall rating.

Additionally, I couldn't figure out how to make the web scraper go to the next page, since yelp only shows a few reviews per
restaurant before you have to click to the second page and then the third page and so on for the rest of the reviews.

Not having this data limited what I wanted to do in seaborn, I was thinking a line graph that showed average rating per year
per restaurant would have been cool, but the data I ended up scraping couldn't support this.

These are the ways I would improve this project, perhaps once I learn how to deal with pagination and understand
HTML a bit better I will be able to come back and redo this.
